# Backend Health Tracker

## Features

This will allow users of my <a href="https://github.com/JessZuchowski/health_tracker/tree/master/HealthTrack"> Health Tracker Android app </a> to view their exercise diary on multiple devices by saving their information to a server.

The Spring backend will have a replica of my exercise model. There will be a POST rout to allow users to create new diary entries and a GET rout to handle entries in the database. 

The Android portion will allow users to POST to the server as well as save to the database.
